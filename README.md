# DeeTorus

Once upon a time in the Victorian England lived a mathematician and scholar, named John Dee.
He is famous (infamous even) about many things, but among others he was studying geometry.
In one of his works he was developing holistic metaphysical models by trying to invent and
apply higher dimensional geometry (what doesn't really exists in his time, so he doesn't use
the modern terms and formulas). Strange late medieval geeks...

However, he had an interesting idea about projecting lattices on higher dimensions (3 and 4
dimensional objects, like torus or hypercube).

Since I am interested on both graph visualiation, programming and metaphysics, this idea
grabbed my imagination. Why not creating a javascript applicaiton allowing you to project
two dimensional lattice graphs to the surface of a three dimensional torus? That would be
fun, for sure :)

But let's make it more generic. It would be great to be able to visualize any kind of static
or time-series annotated graph data, using diferent transformators to project these data between
representations like tables, grids or geometric objects. And not to go too far from John Dee,
let's use some metaphysical data he would be also interested today.

# Technologies

- I never used any online IDE before, so why not :) - https://codesandbox.io/s/x2npwk5mlq
- But let's keep the code version controlled: https://github.com/symat/DeeTorus
- I always wanted to learn modern front-end frameworks, so let's try React with ES
- This stuff will need some more advanced state modificaiton for applying projections, Redux
  seems to manage that just well
- We will also need some visualization libraries.

# Team

- that would be only me (Dr. Mate Szalay-Beko)

# Fun

it is just a hobby project... you can copy/fork/use/change/download/refer to it freely without
consuling me - but of course, I am happy to get any feedback
